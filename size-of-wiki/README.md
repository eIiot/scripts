# Size of Wikipedia Articles for Numbers 1-999

I recently stumbled across the Wikipedia article for the number 237, and I was curious to see if there were articles for any other large numbers. This data in these graphs comes from a simple node script, which queries the Wikipedia API, and grabs the size of the article, in bytes.

Tools used:

- NodeJS
- Wikipedia API
- Google Sheets
